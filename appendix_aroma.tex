The N2 torsion potential was calculated with the def2-TZVPP basis set, while N4 and N8 utilized the 6-31++G**\cite{Hehre1972} basis set to reduce to the computational cost. The deviation of N2 from both N4 and N8 between 0 and 50\textdegree \ is likely due to the different basis sets employed.}

\subsection{Comparison of NICS Aromaticity}

    \caption{N2, N4, and N8 absolute NICS $1_{ZZ}$ values as a function of torsion angle. The magnitude of NICS values decrease with chain length, and we expected that the values will converge once a certain chain length is reached. While the magnitude decreases the overall trend as a function of torsion angle is consistent, which allows N2 to represent larger chains.}

The orange dot represents the relaxed H $\cdots$ S distance on a trans (180\textdegree) BT molecule. This indicates that the H $\cdots$ S through-space interaction is marginally repulsive in trans BT. It is noteworthy that the repulsive energy is small compared to the torsional barrier present at 180\textdegree \ in BT (a factor of $\sim$2.5), which in combination with the NCI analysis below demonstrate the minor role of sterics in determining planarity.}
