abstract = {The behavior of semiflexible chains modeling wormlike polymers such as DNA and actin in confined spaces was explored by coarse-grained Monte Carlo simulations. The persistence length P, mean end-to-end distance R2, mean radius of gyration Rg2, and the size ratio R2/Rg2 were computed for chains in slits, cylinders, and spheres. It was found that the intrinsic persistence length of a free chain undergoes on confinement substantial alteration into the apparent persistence length. The qualitative differences were found in trends of the apparent persistence lengths between slits and cylinders on one side and spheres on the other side. The quantities P, R2, Rg2, and R2/Rg2 display similar dependences upon squeezing the chains in nanopores. The above quantities change nonmonotonically with confinement in slits and cylinders, whereas they drop smoothly with decreasing radius of a sphere. For elongation of a chain in a cylinder, two regimes corresponding to strong and moderate confinements were found and compared to experiments and predictions of the blob and Odijk theories. In a spherical cavity, the toroidal chain structure with a hole in the center was detected under strong confinements. The scattering form factor S(q) computed for semiflexible confined chains revealed three regimes of behavior in a slit and a cylinder that matched up well with the scaling theory. The complex form of the function S(q) computed for a sphere was interpreted as a sign of the toroidal structure. A reasonable agreement was found between the simulations and measurements of DNA and actin filaments, confined in nano- and microfluidic channels and spherical droplets, pertaining to the changes of the persistence lengths, chain elongation, and toroidal structure formation.},

abstract = {Based on density functional theory calculations, the structural and electronic properties of polythiophene in periodic and oligomer forms have been investigated. In particular, the effects of Li or Cl adsorption onto a monolayer and Li or Cl-intercalation into bulk or bilayer polythiophene are addressed using periodic calculations. The binding energy of Li or Cl adsorbed bulk or bilayer polythiophene is significantly larger than for the monolayer. The trends in the binding energy as a function of adsorbent remain the same for both the periodic and molecular cases. The band gap or HOMO-LUMO gap and charge transfer are analysed. In addition, for the bulk or bilayer, different kinds of stacking have been considered. It is found that the parallel bulk or bilayer structure is energetically favorable compared to flipping the second layer by 180{\^{}}. This has been considered for both the periodic and oligomer forms. Moreover, for Li adsorption, polarons are found to be more stable than bipolarons, while the situation is opposite for Cl adsorption. The detailed analysis of the present study will be useful for understanding the structural properties and the tuneability of the electronic states, which is an important step to construct polythiophene based electronic devices.},

abstract = {We report a large bandgap (1.9. eV) donor-acceptor copolymer (named PffT2-FTAZ) that enables polymer solar cells with a high power conversion efficiency of 7.8{\%}. An important structural feature of the PffT2-FTAZ polymer is a difluorinated donor unit (3,3'-difluoro-2,2'-bithiophene, or, ffT2) that introduces several surprising and/or beneficial effects. By comparing PffT2-FTAZ with the analog polymer (PT2-FTAZ) without fluorination on the bithiophene donor unit, it is found that the ffT2 unit effectively lowers the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymer and slightly reduces optical bandgap. It also introduces strong interchain aggregation for the polymer in solution, which leads to a highly crystalline polymer film and reasonably high hole transport mobility. On the other hand, the PffT2-FTAZ: fullerene blend still exhibits a reasonably small polymer domain size suitable for polymer solar cell operation. All these positive factors combined leads to dramatically enhanced performance for the polymer solar cells with the power conversion efficiency increasing from 2.8{\%} for PT2-FTAZ to 7.8{\%} for f PffT2-FTAZ. The high PSC performance of PffT2-FTAZ makes it a promising candidate for high efficiency tandem PSCs.},

Increased temperature is accompanied by a gradual rise in both the degree of nonplanarity and in the associated displacements from this mean position. There is also measurable anisotropy in the equatorial thermal expansion coefficients combined with a small 2, circ drop in the polymer chain setting angle, thereby indicating only a weak approach toward a high-temperature rotator phase.

Especially, through a comparative analysis of linear and cyclic oligothiophenes, we found that the evolution of 0-0 and 0-1 vibronic bands is strongly related to the conformations of cyclic molecular systems, reflecting the extent of exciton delocalization. Collectively, we believe that our findings are applicable to various $\pi$-conjugated organic materials and will provide new insights into the relationship between exciton delocalization and cyclic molecular conformation.},

Conformational flexibility and the confinement of $\pi$ electrons within each aromatic ring are the two factors considered for the explanation of such an observation. The $\pi$-electron confinement is analyzed in terms of the effective conjugation coordinate theory which is related to the amplitude mode theory.

Relaxation was observed through time-dependent evolution in frequencies and intensity ratios of out-of- phase (Z) and in-phase (Я) intraring C?C stretching features. Frequency shifts occurred on time scales of 0.4 and 0.86 ps, respectively, dominated by a blue shift in the Z mode (6.2 and 11.5 cm−1 shifts for 4T and DH4T, respectively). Intensity ratios evolved on similar time scales due to correlated intensity decreases and increases of Z- and Я-mode features. Excited- state quantum-chemical calculations with bithiophene demonstrate that mode frequencies are coupled to the torsional dihedral, such that the spectral evolution observed reflects excited-state relaxation toward a planar conformation. This work demonstrates the power of ultrafast Raman spectroscopy for probing dynamics in photoexcited conjugated materials with structural detail given the parametric dependence of intraring vibrational modes on interring torsional dihedrals.

Oligothiophenes, oligophenylene-vinylenes, oligoperylenes (oligophenyls) derivatives are studied in a common context. These shifts are taken as spectroscopic fingerprints of the changes in ??conjugation. For a given family, aromatic and quinoidal oligomers have been studied together and according with their Raman frequency shifts located in the two-well BLA- energy curve of their ground electronic state as a function of the bond-length-alternation pattern (BLA). The connection among BLA, pi-conjugation and Raman frequencies is taken here as the basis of our study. These Raman shifts/BLA changes have been related to important electronic properties of these one-dimension linear ??electron delocalized systems such as quinoidal (polyene) and aromatic characters.},

abstract = {Conformational disorder of conjugated polymers is an important issue to be understood and quantified. In this paper we present a new method to assess the chain conformation of conjugated polymers based on measurements of intrachain energy transfer. The chain conformation is modeled on the basis of monomer-monomer interactions, such as torsion, bending, and stretching of the connecting bond. The latter two potentials are assumed to be harmonic, while the torsional potential was calculated by density functional theory using B3-LYP functional with the SVP basis set. The energy transfer dynamics of excitons on these chains are quantitatively simulated using Forster-type line-dipole energy transfer. This allows us to compare the simulated ground state conformation of single polymer chains to ultrafast depolarization experiments of poly [3-(2,5-dioctylphenyl)thiophene] in solution. We identify torsional rotation as the main contributor to conformational disorder and find that this disorder is mainly controlled by the energy difference between syn and anti bonds.},

Because the relative roles of individual defects are experimentally difficult to discern, computational approaches provide valuable insight if appropriate molecular models are used. Poly(3-alkylthiophenes) are often modeled with very short backbones and without their side chains. We demonstrate the shortcomings of this approach for modeling torsional disorder in poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT). Using a hybrid density functional model, we identify a minimal acceptable model to comprise approximately 10 monomers with explicitly treated alkane side chains.

abstract = {Neuromorphic computing could address the inherent limitations of conventional silicon technology in dedicated machine learning applications. Recent work on silicon-based asynchronous spiking neural networks and large crossbar arrays of two-terminal memristive devices has led to the development of promising neuromorphic systems. However, delivering a compact and efficient parallel computing technology that is capable of embedding artificial neural networks in hardware remains a significant challenge. Organic electronic materials offer an attractive option for such systems and could provide biocompatible and relatively inexpensive neuromorphic devices with low-energy switching and excellent tunability. Here, we review the development of organic neuromorphic devices. We consider different resistance-switching mechanisms, which typically rely on electrochemical doping or charge trapping, and report approaches that enhance state retention and conductance tuning. We also discuss the challenges the field faces in implementing low-power neuromorphic computing, such as device downscaling and improving device speed. Finally, we highlight early demonstrations of device integration into arrays, and consider future directions and potential applications of this technology.},

It is found that excitons generated in the bulk poly(p-phenylene vinylene) (PPV) phase require an activation energy of 0.23 eV to reach the heterojunction interfaces before getting their charges separated. Electron transfers from the D*(1) state of PPV to the t*(1u) state of C-60 follow the nonadiabatic mechanism, which is accelerated by three major factors inclucling the 0.95 eV energy drop between the two states, close vicinity of the electron-donating D*(1) state to the C-60 phase, and suppressed inversion symmetry of C-60 at the interfaces. The irreversible phonon relaxation energy associated with the nonadiabatic electron transfer is estimated to be 0.3 eV, which explains the widely accepted empirical energy offsets between the measured open-circuit voltage and the theoretical built-in potential.},

Using time- resolved and single-molecule spectroscopic techniques, the effect of chain length on the exciton dynamics in a series of linear oligothiophenes, for which the conformational disorder increased with increasing chain length, was investigated. As a result, extraordinary features of the exciton dynamics in longer-chain oligothiophene were revealed. Ultrafast fluorescence depolarization processes were observed due to exciton self-trapping in longer and bent chains. Increase in exciton delocalization during dynamic planarization processes was also observed in the linear oligothio- phenes via time-resolved fluorescence spectra but was restricted in L-10T because of its considerable conformational disorder. Exciton delocalization was also unexpectedly observed in a bent chain using single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy. Such delocalization modulates the fluorescence spectral shape by attenuating the 0−0 peak intensity. Collectively, these results provide significant insights into the exciton dynamics in conjugated polymers. M},

abstract = {A combination of transient absorption (TAS) and femtosecond stimulated Raman (FSRS) spectroscopies were used to interrogate the photo-induced nuclear relaxation dynamics of poly(3-cyclohexyl,4-methylthiophene) (PCMT). The large difference in inter-ring dihedral angles of ground and excited-state PCMT make it an ideal candidate for studying large-amplitude vibrational relaxation associated with exciton trapping. Spectral shifting in the S1 TA spectra on sub-ps timescales (110 ± 20 and 800 ± 100 fs) is similar to spectroscopic signatures of excited-state relaxation observed with related photoexcited conjugated polymers and which have been attributed to exciton localization and a combination of resonant energy transfer and torsional relaxation, respectively. Measurements made with both techniques reveal fast PCMT S1 decay and triplet formation ($\tau$S1 = 25-32 ps), which is similar to the excited-state dynamics of short oligothiophenes and highly twisted polyconjugated molecules. On ultrafast timescales FSRS of S1 PCMT offers a new perspective on the nuclear dynamics that underlie localization of excitons in photoexcited conjugated polymers: Spectral dynamics in the C=C stretching region (1400-1600 cm(-1)) include a red-shift of the in-phase C=C stretching frequency, as well as a change in the relative intensity of in-phase and out-of-phase stretch intensities on a timescale of ∼100 fs. Both changes indicate an ultrafast vibrational distortion that increases the conjugation length in the region of the localized excitation and are consistent with exciton self-localization or trapping. Wavelength-dependent excited-state FSRS measurements further demonstrate that the C=C stretching frequency provides a useful spectroscopic handle for interrogating the degree of delocalization in excited conjugated polymers given the selectivity achieved via resonance enhancement.},

However, these strategies present limitations for large-scale high-throughput processing due to associated pre- and/or post semiconductor deposition steps. Here, photoinduced anisotropic supramolecular assembly of P3HT chains in solution is demonstrated. UV irradiation provides for enhanced intramolecular ordering of solubilized polymer chains, and thereby effects formation of anisotropic supramolecular polymer assemblies via favorable $\pi$–$\pi$ stacking (intermolecular interaction). Molecular ordering is thus dramatically enhanced with concomitant, enhanced charge transport characteristics of corresponding films. Additional pre- and/or post treatments are avoided.},

Measured spectral dynamics reflect initial changes in the resonance enhancement of backbone modes on a time scale of 9 簣 1 ps. In contrast, contributions from peripheral modes exhibit time-dependent decay determined only by exciton intersystem-crossing kinetics. Spectral dynamics are interpreted in terms of evolution in bond lengths along the exciton?s backbone resulting from increased conjugation allowed by torsional reordering. Possible origins of peripheral features are discussed, including distorted inter-ring modes at exciton termini. Findings provide a glimpse of the underlying molecular dynamics responsible for the red shift in the exciton?s near-IR transient absorption occurring on the same time scale.},

Electron-excessive/deficient heterocyclic bridges have lesser/greater tendency to deplete the electron density from the donor/acceptor groups and thus increase their donor/acceptor ability. Thus, electron-excessive heterocyclic bridges act as auxiliary donors while electron-deficient heterocyclic bridges act as auxiliary acceptors, significantly enhancing NLO response.

abstract = {An extension of d. functional theory to situations with significant nondynamical correlation is presented. The method is based on the spin-flip (SF) approach which is capable of describing multireference wave functions within a single ref. formalism as spin-flipping, e.g., $\alpha$ $\beta$, excitations from a high-spin (Ms=1) triplet ref. state. An implementation of the spin-flip approach within the Tamm-Dancoff approxn. to time-dependent d. functional theory (TDDFT) is presented. The new method, SF-TDDFT/TDA or simply SF-DFT, describes target states (i.e., closed- and open-shell singlets, as well as low-spin triplets) by linear response from a ref. high-spin triplet (Ms=1) Kohn-Sham state. Contrary to traditional TDDFT, the SF-DFT response equations are solved in a subspace of spin-flipping operators. The method is applied to bond-breaking (ethylene torsional potential), and equil. properties of eight diradicals. The results demonstrate significant improvement over traditional Kohn-Sham DFT, particularly for 50/50 hybrid functional. [on SciFinder(R)]},

abstract = {Energetic positions of singlet and triplet states of small alpha-oligothiophenes with n = 2, 3 and 4 monomer units were measured by photodetachment photoelectron spectroscopy (PD-PES), phosphorescence and time resolved pump-probe spectroscopy. The triplet energy of T-1 and T-2 were determined experimentally for the first time in the gas phase. The triplet manifold could be extended including the levels observed by triplet-triplet absorption. The transition energies of singlet and triplet states decrease with increasing size n of the oligothiophenes following the extended free electron model(FEMO). The Delta E(n) curves have different slopes for the singlet S-1 and triplet T-2 states with an intersection at n = 2. The mutual positions of S-1 and T-2 states at equal energy for 2T explain the extremely high triplet quantum yield of 2T and its successive decrease for larger nT. The present measurements, combined with literature data, allow for the first time a complete picture to be drawn of all electronic states which are relevant for photodynamic processes in oligothiophenes with n = 1-4.},

The observations are explained in terms of exciton-phonon coupling that is dominated by only two motions: one high frequency bond stretch and a low frequency torsional motion. Numerical simulations of the 2C-3PEPS are shown to be consistent with the experimental observations.

It is therefore useful to have computational protocols for accurate estimation of their electronic spectra in order to screen candidate molecules for OLED applications. However, it is difficult to predict the photophysical properties of TADF molecules with LR-TDDFT, as semilocal LR-TDDFT is incapable of accurately modeling CT states. Herein, we study absorption energies, emission energies, zero–zero transition energies, and singlet–triplet gaps of TADF molecules using a restricted open-shell Kohn–Sham (ROKS) approach instead and discover that ROKS calculations with semilocal hybrid functionals are in good agreement with experiments—unlike TDDFT, which significantly underestimates energy gaps.

abstract = {Ab-initio Hartree-Fock and valence-effective-Hamiltonian calcns. were done on polyparaphenylene, polypyrrole, and polythiophene dimers, and polymer chains. A study was made, as a function of the torsion angle between consecutive rings, of electronic properties such as ionization potential, band gap and width of the highest occupied bands, and of the carbon-carbon bond length between rings. Many derivs. of these compds. have substituents that lead to an increase of the torsion angle between adjacent rings, as a result of steric interactions. On going from a coplanar to a perpendicular conformation, the ionization potential and bandgap increase, and the width of the highest occupied bands decreases. This makes it more difficult to ionize or reduce the polymer chains, and can result in achieving lower max. elec. conductivities on doping. Since the evolution of the electronic properties follows a cosine law (related to the decrease of the overlap between the p orbitals on adjacent rings), the modifications up to .apprx.40 Deg torsion angle are not very large. In all three polymers, the ionization potential for a 40 Deg torsion angle is about 0.4 eV larger than the coplanar-conformation value. Therefore, substituents that lead to torsion angles between consecutive rings smaller than 40 Deg are quite acceptable. For the substituted compds. the importance is discussed of the possibility of achieving a coplanar conformation upon doping, to permit high intrachain mobilities of charge carriers such as bipolarons.

abstract = {Oligothiophenes and polythiophenes are building blocks of organic-based energy conversion materials. Therefore the lifetime of the excited states plays a central role. As a first step to understand the factors influencing the performance, we investigated the deactivation processes from the first excited state S1 of thiophene and small oligothiophenes containing up to four rings using quantum chemical calculations. For thiophene a low-lying S1/S0 conical intersection seam is easily accessible and drives the fast internal conversion. In oligothiophenes barriers inhibit this passage while deactivation pathways via intersystem crossing channels open. The first one is responsible for the high triplet quantum yields and takes place shortly after the Franck-Condon region. The second one occurs in the vicinity of a local S1 minimum. The calculated spin-orbit coupling strength together with the singlet-triplet energy gaps can explain the decreasing triplet and increasing fluorescence quantum yields for growing chain length. From the triplets the ground state is reachable by inter-ring torsions and T1/S0 intersections. The present results allow a deeper understanding of the deactivation pathways of thiophene and small oligothiophenes and are of potential interest for the photophysics of longer oligothiophenes and polythiophenes used in optical devices.},

abstract = {To address the intrinsic contradiction between high optoelectronic properties and good processability in organic $\pi$-conjugated molecules, we propose that soft-conjugated molecules (SCMs), conformationally locked by intramolecular nonbonding interactions, can benefit from both nonplanar molecular structures in solution for processing and rigid coplanar structures in the solid state for enhanced optoelectronic properties. Computational results reveal that nonbonding pairs of S{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}N, N{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}H, and F{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}S are strong enough to prevail over thermal fluctuations, steric effects, and other repulsive interactions to force the adjacent aromatic rings to be planar; thus, constructed SCMs display delocalized frontier molecular orbitals with frontier orbital energy levels, band gaps, reorganization energies, and photophyscial properties comparable to those of rigid-conjugated molecules because of their stable planar soft-conjugation at both ground and excited states.

abstract = {Polypyrrole (PPy) is a biocompatible, electrically conductive polymer that has great potential for battery, sensor, and neural implant applications. Its amorphous structure and insolubility, however, limit the experimental techniques available to study its structure and properties at the atomic level. Previous theoretical studies of PPy in bulk are also scarce. Using ab initio calculations, we have constructed a molecular mechanics force field of chloride-doped PPy (PPyCl) and undoped PPy. This model has been designed to integrate into the OPLS force field, and parameters are available for the Gromacs and TINKER software packages. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of bulk PPy and PPyCl have been performed using this force field, and the effects of chain packing and electrostatic scaling on the bulk polymer density have been investigated. The density of flotation of PPyCl films has been measured experimentally. Amorphous X-ray diffraction of PPyCl was obtained and correlated with atomic structures sampled from MD simulations. The force field reported here is foundational for bridging the gap between experimental measurements and theoretical calculations for PPy based materials. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Many molecules can rotate internally around one or more of their bonds so that during a full 360 degrees rotation, they will change between unstable and relatively stable conformations. Ethane is the textbook example of a molecule exhibiting such behaviour: as one of its two methyl (CH3) groups rotates once around the central carbon-carbon bond, the molecule will alternate three times between an unstable eclipsed conformation and the preferred staggered conformation. This structural preference is usually attributed to steric effects; that is, while ethane rotates towards an eclipsed structure, the electrons in C-H bonds on the different C atoms are drawing closer to each other and therefore experience increased repulsion, introducing a rotation barrier that destabilizes the eclipsed structure. Stabilization of the staggered structure through rotation-induced weakening of the central C-C bond and hyperconjugation has been considered to be involved, but evaluation of the contributions of these effects to ethane's internal rotation barrier and conformational preference remains difficult. Here we report a series of ethane structure optimizations, where successive removal of different interactions indicates that ethane's staggered conformation is the result of preferential stabilization through hyperconjugation. Removal of hyperconjugation interactions yields the eclipsed structure as the preferred conformation, whereas repulsive forces, either present or absent, have no influence on the preference for a staggered conformation.},

Top-gate and bottom-contact (TGBC) organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) of all the polymers exhibited ambipolar transport behavior. The devices based on P4FTAT-C40 displayed poor device performance since its film was almost amorphous.

These methods must go through tedious steps to get high-purity bifunctional organometallic reagents and may also involve toxic organotin compounds and byproducts. Certainly,},

Several modifications in the Raman spectra of doped PPV compared to neutral PPV are analyzed and interpreted by the coexistence of polaronic and bipolaronic species in the sample.

As a relatively new technique, however, much work is needed to understand the resulting polymer–dopant interactions upon sequential doping. A combination of infrared spectroscopy and theoretical simulations shows that the dopants selectively placed in the amorphous regions in the film via sequential doping result in highly localized polarons. We find that the presence of dopants within the amorphous regions of the film leads to an increase in conjugation length of the amorphous chains upon doping, increasing film connectivity and hence improving the overall conductivity of the film compared with the conventional doping processes.},

The algorithm assumes that the configuration of a part of the polymer (a few monomers length) can be sampled from the configuration of a PPV trimer.  The probabilities of the configurations of the trimer are taken as the Boltzmann wt. of the energies.  We constructed several types of polymers with different nos. of cis-defects which were added to the polymer either uniformly or randomly distributed within the entire polymer.  Polymer characteristics, such as conjugation length, end-to-end distance, and radius of gyration, were also calcd.  The trends of these characteristics were found to be inversely proportional with the no. of cis-defects in the polymer.  Although av. conjugation lengths are generally independent of the distribution of cis-defects, the morphol. of the polymer is dependent on cis-defect distribution.  This suggests that conformational disorder rather than cis-defect d. is the detg. factor in exciton localization and diffusion in these systems.  Finally, we derive a simple model similar to the Ising model that relates the energy needed to break conjugation to the av. conjugation length.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The mechanisms controlling excitation energy transport (EET) in light-harvesting complexes remain controversial. Following the observation of long-lived beats in 2D electronic spectroscopy of PC645, vibronic coherence, the delocalization of excited states between pigments supported by a resonant vibration, has been proposed to enable direct excitation transport from the highest-energy to the lowest-energy pigments, bypassing a collection of intermediate states. Here, we instead show that for phycobiliprotein PC645 an incoherent vibronic transport mechanism is at play. We quantify the solvation dynamics of individual pigments using ab initio quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) nuclear dynamics. Our atomistic spectral densities reproduce experimental observations ranging from absorption and fluorescence spectra to the timescales and selectivity of down-conversion observed in transient absorption measurements. We construct a general model for vibronic dimers and establish the parameter regimes of coherent and incoherent vibronic transport. We demonstrate that direct down-conversion in PC645 proceeds incoherently, enhanced by large reorganization energies and a broad collection of high-frequency vibrations. We suggest that a similar incoherent mechanism is appropriate across phycobiliproteins and represents a potential design principle for nanoscale control of EET.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {We have measured the conductance of single-molecule junctions created with three different molecular wires using the scanning tunneling microscope-based break-junction technique. Each wire contains one of three different cyclic five-membered rings: cyclopentadiene, furan, or thiophene. We find that the single-molecule conductance of these three wires correlates negatively with the resonance energy of the five-membered ring; the nonaromatic cyclopentadiene derivative has the highest conductance, while the most aromatic of this series, thiophene, has the lowest. Furthermore, we show for another wire structure that the conductance of furan-based wires is consistently higher than for analogous thiophene systems, indicating that the negative correlation between conductance and aromaticity is robust. The best conductance would be for a quinoid structure that diminishes aromaticity. The energy penalty for partly adopting the quinoid structure is less with compounds having lower initial aromatic stabilization. An additional effect may reflect the lower HOMOs of aromatic compounds.},

abstract = {Broadband femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy is used to explore the mechanisms underlying excited-state and ground-state exciton relaxation in poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) solution. We focus on the picosecond spectral shifts in the ground and excited states of P3HT, using pump–probe (PP) and pump–dump–probe (PDP) techniques to investigate exciton relaxation mechanisms. Excited-state PP signals resolved a dynamic stimulated emission Stokes shift and ground-state reorganization; PDP signals resolved a blue-shifting nonequilibrium ground-state bleach. Initial structural reorganization is shown to be faster in the excited state. Ground-state reorganization is shown to be dependent on dump time, with later times resulting in relatively more population undergoing slow (20 ps) reorganization. These observations are discussed in the context of structural relaxation involving small-scale ({\textless}1 ps) and large-scale ({\textgreater}1 ps) planarization of thiophene groups following photoexcitation. Excited-state and ground-state dynamics are contrasted in terms of electronic structure defining the torsional potential energy surfaces. It is shown that the primary excitonic relaxation mechanism is excited-state self-trapping via torsional relaxation rather than exciton energy transfer.},

The delocalized excited states of conjugated polymers are short-lived ($\tau$ {\textless} 40 fs) but are imperative in the photovoltaic properties of these materials. Photoexcitation of poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) induces an excited-state absorption band, but the transitions that are involved are not well understood. In this work, calculations have been performed on P3HT analogues using nonlinear response time-dependent density functional theory to show that an increase in the oligomer length correlates with the dominance of the S1 → S3 transition. Furthermore, the predicted transition energy shows an excellent agreement with experiment. The calculations also yielded results on intramolecular charge transfer in P3HT due to the S1 → S3 transition, providing insight into the mechanism of exciton dissociation to form charge carriers.},

Assuming the exact exchange–correlation (XC) functional is applied, UDFT and TDDFT provide identical energies for T1 (ET), which is also a constraint that we require our XC functionals to obey. However, this condition is not satisfied by most of the popular XC functionals, leading to inaccurate predictions of low-lying, spectroscopically and photochemically important excited states, such as T1 and the lowest singlet excited state (S1). Inspired by the optimal tuning strategy for frontier orbital energies [T. Stein, L. Kronik, and R. Baer, J. Am. Chem.

abstract = {CONSPECTUS: Density functional theory (DFT) and its time-dependent extension (TD-DFT) are powerful tools enabling the theoretical prediction of the ground- and excited-state properties of organic electronic materials with reasonable accuracy at affordable computational costs. Due to their excellent accuracy-to-numerical-costs ratio, semilocal and global hybrid functionals such as B3LYP have become the workhorse for geometry optimizations and the prediction of vibrational spectra in modern theoretical organic chemistry. Despite the overwhelming success of these out-of-the-box functionals for such applications, the computational treatment of electronic and structural properties that are of particular interest in organic electronic materials sometimes reveals severe and qualitative failures of such functionals. Important examples include the overestimation of conjugation, torsional barriers, and electronic coupling as well as the underestimation of bond-length alternations or excited-state energies in low-band-gap polymers. In this Account, we highlight how these failures can be traced back to the delocalization error inherent to semilocal and global hybrid functionals, which leads to the spurious delocalization of electron densities and an overestimation of conjugation. The delocalization error for systems and functionals of interest can be quantified by allowing for fractional occupation of the highest occupied molecular orbital. It can be minimized by using long-range corrected hybrid functionals and a nonempirical tuning procedure for the range-separation parameter. We then review the benefits and drawbacks of using tuned long-range corrected hybrid functionals for the description of the ground and excited states of $\pi$-conjugated systems. In particular, we show that this approach provides for robust and efficient means of characterizing the electronic couplings in organic mixed-valence systems, for the calculation of accurate torsional barriers at the polymer limit, and for the reliable prediction of the optical absorption spectrum of low-band-gap polymers. We also explain why the use of standard, out-of-the-box range-separation parameters is not recommended for the DFT and/or TD-DFT description of the ground and excited states of extended, pi-conjugated systems. Finally, we highlight a severe drawback of tuned range-separated hybrid functionals by discussing the example of the calculation of bond-length alternation in polyacetylene, which leads us to point out the challenges for future developments in this field.},

Understanding charge transport in such systems, which have amorphous and ordered phases exhibiting varying degrees of order, has proved difficult owing to the contribution of electronic processes at various length scales. The growing technological appeal of these semiconductors makes such fundamental knowledge extremely important for materials and process design. We propose a unified model of how charge carriers travel in conjugated polymer films. We show that in high-molecular-weight semiconducting polymers the limiting charge transport step is trapping caused by lattice disorder, and that short-range intermolecular aggregation is sufficient for efficient long-range charge transport. This generalization explains the seemingly contradicting high performance of recently reported, poorly ordered polymers and suggests molecular design strategies to further improve the performance of future generations of organic electronic materials.},

abstract = {Charge carriers typically move faster in crystalline regions than in amorphous regions in conjugated polymers because polymer chains adopt a regular arrangement resulting in a high degree of $\pi$−$\pi$ stacking in crystalline regions. In contrast, the random polymer chain orientation in amorphous regions hinders connectivity between conjugated backbones; thus, it hinders charge carrier delocalization. Various studies have attempted to enhance charge carrier transport by increasing crystallinity. However, these ap-proaches are inevitably limited by the semicrystalline nature of conjugated polymers. Moreover, high-crystallinity conjugated polymers have proven inadequate for soft electronics applications because of their poor mechanical resilience. Increasing the polymer chain connectivity by forming localized aggregates via $\pi$-orbital overlap among several conjugated backbones in amorphous regions provides a more effective approach to efficient charge carrier transport. A simple strategy relying on the density of random copolymer alkyl side chains was developed to generate these localized aggregates. In this strategy, steric hindrance caused by these side chains was modulated to change their density. Interestingly, a random polymer exhibiting low alkyl side chain density and crystallinity displayed greatly enhanced field-effect mobility (1.37 cm 2 /(V{\textperiodcentered}s)) compared with highly crystalline poly(3-hexylthiophene). ■ INTRODUCTION Various conjugated polymers (CPs) have found use in organic field-effect transistor (OFET) applications because of their tunable electronic properties, solution processability, and applicability to soft electronics. 1−13 Most CPs form compli-cated microstructures combining crystalline and amorphous domains due to their semicrystalline nature. This heterogeneity has significantly affected the performance of resulting OFETs. 14−18},

abstract = {Charge carrier localization in extended atomic systems can be driven by disorder, point defects or distortions of the ionic lattice. Herein we give first-principles theoretical computational evidence that it can also appear as a purely electronic effect in otherwise perfectly ordered periodic structures. Optimally-tuned range separated density functional calculations reveal that in trans-polyacetylene and polythiophene the hole density localizes on a length scale of several nanometers. This is due to exchange induced translational symmetry breaking of the charge density. Ionization potentials, optical absorption peaks, excitonic binding energies and the optimally-tuned range parameter itself all become independent of polymer length when it exceeds the critical localization length scale. These first-principles findings show, for the first time, that charge localization is not caused by lattice distortion but it is rather its cause. This helps to explain experimental findings that polarons in conjugated polymers form instantaneously after exposure to ultrafast light pulses.},

The main factors motivating investigations of organic transistors are their lower cost and simpler packaging, relative to conventional inorganic electronics, and their compatibility with flexible substrates. In most digital circuitry, minimal power dissipation and stability of performance against transistor parameter variations are crucial. In silicon-based microelectronics, these are achieved through the use of complementary logic-which incorporates both p- and n-type transistors-and it is therefore reasonable to suppose that adoption of such an approach with organic semiconductors will similarly result in reduced power dissipation, improved noise margins and greater operational stability. Complementary inverters and ring oscillators have already been reported. Here we show that such an approach can realize much larger scales of integration (in the present case, up to 864 transistors per circuit) and operation speeds of approximately 1 kHz in clocked sequential complementary circuits.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.Thin-film field-effect transistors are essential elements of stretchable electronic devices for wearable electronics. All of the materials and components of such transistors need to be stretchable and mechanically robust. Although there has been recent progress towards stretchable conductors, the realization of stretchable semiconductors has focused mainly on strain-accommodating engineering of materials, or blending of nanofibres or nanowires into elastomers. An alternative approach relies on using semiconductors that are intrinsically stretchable, so that they can be fabricated using standard processing methods. Molecular stretchability can be enhanced when conjugated polymers, containing modified side-chains and segmented backbones, are infused with more flexible molecular building blocks. Here we present a design concept for stretchable semiconducting polymers, which involves introducing chemical moieties to promote dynamic non-covalent crosslinking of the conjugated polymers. These non-covalent crosslinking moieties are able to undergo an energy dissipation mechanism through breakage of bonds when strain is applied, while retaining high charge transport abilities. As a result, our polymer is able to recover its high field-effect mobility performance (more than 1 square centimetre per volt per second) even after a hundred cycles at 100 per cent applied strain. Organic thin-film field-effect transistors fabricated from these materials exhibited mobility as high as 1.3 square centimetres per volt per second and a high on/off current ratio exceeding a million. The field-effect mobility remained as high as 1.12 square centimetres per volt per second at 100 per cent strain along the direction perpendicular to the strain. The field-effect mobility of damaged devices can be almost fully recovered after a solvent and thermal healing treatment. Finally, we successfully fabricated a skin-inspired stretchable organic transistor operating under deformations that might be expected in a wearable device.},

We propose that the starting point for understanding conjugated polymers includes understanding chain conformations and phase behavior. Efforts to predict and measure the persistence length have significantly refined our intuition of the chain stiffness, and have led to predictions of nematic-to-isotropic transitions. Exploring mixing between conjugated polymers and small molecules or other polymers has demonstrated tremendous advancements in attaining the needed properties for various optoelectronic devices.

abstract = {Constructing highly planar, extended $\pi$-electron systems is an important strategy for achieving high-mobility organic semiconductors. In general, there are two synthetic strategies for achieving $\pi$-conjugated systems with high planarity. The conventional strategy connects neighboring aromatic rings through covalent bonds to restrict the rotation about single bonds. However, this usually requires a complex sequence of synthetic steps to achieve this target, which can be costly and labor-intensive. More recently, noncovalent through-space intramolecular interactions, which are defined here as noncovalent conformational locks, have been employed with great success to increase the planarity and rigidity of extended $\pi$-electron systems; this has become a well-known and important strategy to design and synthesize highly planar $\pi$-conjugated systems for organic electronics.

abstract = {Non-covalent interactions hold the key to understanding many chemical, biological, and technological problems. Describing these non-covalent interactions accurately, including their positions in real space, constitutes a first step in the process of decoupling the complex balance of forces that define non-covalent interactions. Because of the size of macromolecules, the most common approach has been to assign van der Waals interactions (vdW), steric clashes (SC), and hydrogen bonds (HBs) based on pairwise distances between atoms according to their van der Waals radii. We recently developed an alternative perspective, derived from the electronic density: the Non-Covalent Interactions (NCI) index [J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010, 132, 6498]. This index has the dual advantages of being generally transferable to diverse chemical applications and being very fast to compute, since it can be calculated from promolecular densities. Thus, NCI analysis is applicable to large systems, including proteins and DNA, where analysis of non-covalent interactions is of great potential value. Here, we describe the NCI computational algorithms and their implementation for the analysis and visualization of weak interactions, using both self-consistent fully quantum-mechanical, as well as promolecular, densities. A wide range of options for tuning the range of interactions to be plotted is also presented. To demonstrate the capabilities of our approach, several examples are given from organic, inorganic, solid state, and macromolecular chemistry, including cases where NCI analysis gives insight into unconventional chemical bonding.

abstract = {The intrinsic strength of pi interactions in conjugated and hyperconjugated molecules has been calculated using density functional theory by energy decomposition analysis (EDA) of the interaction energy between the conjugating fragments. The results of the EDA of the trans-polyenes H2C=CH-(HC=CH)n-CH=CH2 (n = 1-3) show that the strength of pi conjugation for each C=C moiety is higher than in trans-1,3-butadiene. The absolute values for the conjugation between Si=Si pi bonds are around two-thirds of the conjugation between C=C bonds but the relative contributions of DeltaE pi to DeltaE orb in the all-silicon systems are higher than in the carbon compounds. The pi conjugation between C=C and C=O or C=NH bonds in H2C=CH--C(H)=O and H2C=CH-C(H)=NH is comparable to the strength of the conjugation between C=C bonds. The pi conjugation in H2C=CH-C(R)=O decreases when R = Me, OH, and NH2 while it increases when R = halogen. The hyperconjugation in ethane is around a quarter as strong as the pi conjugation in ethyne. Very strong hyperconjugation is found in the central C-C bonds in cubylcubane and tetrahedranyltetrahedrane. The hyperconjugation in substituted ethanes X3C-CY3 (X,Y = Me, SiH3, F, Cl) is stronger than in the parent compound particularly when X,Y = SiH3 and Cl. The hyperconjugation in donor-acceptor-substituted ethanes may be very strong; the largest DeltaE pi value was calculated for (SiH3)3C-CCl3 in which the hyperconjugation is stronger than the conjugation in ethene. The breakdown of the hyperconjugation in X3C-CY3 shows that donation of the donor-substituted moiety to the acceptor group is as expected the most important contribution but the reverse interaction is not negligible. The relative strengths of the pi interactions between two C=C double bonds, one C=C double bond and CH3 or CMe3 substituents, and between two CH3 or CMe3 groups, which are separated by one C-C single bond, are in a ratio of 4:2:1. Very strong hyperconjugation is found in HC[triple bond]C-C(SiH3)3 and HC[triple bond]C-CCl3. The extra stabilization of alkenes and alkynes with central multiple bonds over their terminal isomers coming from hyperconjugation is bigger than the total energy difference between the isomeric species. The hyperconjugation in Me-C(R)=O is half as strong as the conjugation in H2C=CH-C(R)=O and shows the same trend for different substituents R. Bond energies and lengths should not be used as indicators of the strength of hyperconjugation because the effect of sigma interactions and electrostatic forces may compensate for the hyperconjugative effect.},

abstract = {The degree of aromaticity of monosubstituted derivatives of benzene has been investigated using different aromaticity indices calculated on the basis of molecular structure obtained at the MP2/cc-pvdz level of theory. It is demonstrated that, due to the violation of symmetry in $\pi$-systems, the introduction of any substituent in the benzene ring results in a decrease in the degree of aromaticity. It has been found that structural Bird and HOMA aromaticity indices do not reflect the strength of substituents and their ability to perturb ring electronic density in the benzene ring. The application of magnetic indices NICS0 and NICS1 results in an overestimation of aromaticity of substituted molecules with respect to benzene. Modifications of these indices (NICS-z and NICS-anis) reproduce well the character of the substituents except for functional groups containing carbonyl bonds. The values of NICS-z and NICS-anis correlate well with the ring out-of-plane deformation energy. However, the values of the ring deformation energy agree very well with the strength of all substituents including those containing carbonyl. Therefore, out-of-plane ring deformability is a more universal and sensitive aromaticity index than the known structural and magnetic indices. The values of ring deformation energy demonstrate linear correlation with the substituent that is constant for electron-donation and electron-withdrawing substituents. However, the former functional groups perturb more significantly the aromatic ring electron density. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Organochalcogen-nitrogen heterocycles such as the 1,2,5-chalcogenadiazoles have a distinct tendency to establish intermolecular links in the solid state through secondary bonding interactions E...N (E = S, Se, Te). The association of these molecules was examined in detail using relativistic density functional theory. Although there is an important electrostatic component, the interaction between these molecules is dominated by contributions arising from orbital mixing, which can be interpreted as the donation of a nitrogen lone pair into the chalcogen-centered antibonding orbitals. Because of its more polar character and lower-lying antibonding orbitals, the tellurium derivatives possess the strongest association energies; these are so large that the binding strength is comparable to that of some hydrogen bonds. In the absence of steric constraints, telluradiazoles associate in a coplanar fashion forming ribbon polymers. However, bulky susbstituents could be used to direct the formation of either helical chains or discrete dimers. In addition to its strength, the coplanar dimer is characterized by being rigid, yet no activation barrier is expected for the association/dissociation process. These attributes strongly indicate that tellurium-nitrogen heterocycles have great potential as building blocks in supramolecular architecture.},

abstract = {We report a series of benzotriazole-based semicrystalline pi-conjugated polymers with noncovalent conformational locks for applications in polymer field-effect transistors. The benzotriazole moiety is a versatile electron-deficient building block that offers two chemically functionalizable sites, 2(N) and 5, 6(C) positions,. allowing easy modulation of the solution processability and electronic structures of the resulting polymers. Fluorine or alkoxy substituents were introduced to the benzotriazole unit to enhance the molecular ordering through intra- and intermolecular F center dot center dot center dot S, F center dot center dot center dot H-C, C-F center dot center dot center dot pi(F), or S center dot center dot center dot O attractive interactions. The fluorinated polymer (PTBTz-F) showed remarkably enhanced hole mobility (mu(h) = 1.9 cm(2)/(V.S), on/off ratio = 8 x 10(7)) upon thermal annealing at 305 degrees C, compared to the unsubstituted one (PTBTz) (mu(h) = 7.0 x 10(-3) cm(2)/(V.s), on/off ratio = 3 x 10(6)). Alkoxy unit substitution (PTBTz-OR) also improved the carrier mobility up to 0.019 cm(2)/(V.s) with an on/off ratio of 4 x 10(5). Fluorine or alkoxy substitution induced tight interchain ordering with edge-on orientation, as confirmed by X-ray diffraction measurements. In particular, fluorinated PTBTz-F showed high thermal stability (T-d 453 degrees C) and the remarkable device characteristics with deep frontier orbital levels.},

abstract = {Nucleus-independent chemical shifts (NICS) have been used extensively for the identification of aromaticity properties of molecules, ions, intermediates, and transition states since their introduction in 1996 by Schleyer et al. Initially, probes (bq's) were placed at the centers of systems (NICS(0)) and later, 1A above the molecular planes (NICS(1)). However, contradicting assignments of aromaticity by NICS and other methods were found for some systems. In this article, an alternative NICS-based method is introduced. The method is based on scanning NICS values over a distance and separating them into in-plane and out-of plane contributions. The shapes of the plots of the chemical shifts and their components as a function of the distance of the NICS probe (bq) from the molecular plane give a clear indication of diamagnetic and paramagnetic ring currents. This method is applied to several (4n + 2)- and 4n pi-electron systems (molecules and ions) in the singlet and triplet electronic states, including some of the problematic systems mentioned above. It is also shown that relative aromaticities of rings in polycyclic systems (local aromaticities) cannot be estimated by comparing NICS or NICS-scan values.},

abstract = {The modeling of the conformational properties of conjugated polymers entails a unique challenge for classical force fields. Conjugation imposes strong constraints upon bond rotation. Planar configurations are favored, but the concomitantly shortened bond lengths result in moieties being brought into closer proximity than usual. The ensuing steric repulsions are particularly severe in the presence of side chains, straining angles, and stretching bonds to a degree infrequently found in nonconjugated systems. We herein demonstrate the resulting inaccuracies by comparing the LMP2-calculated inter-ring torsion potentials for a series of substituted stilbenes and bithiophenes to those calculated using standard classical force fields. We then implement adjustments to the OPLS-2005 force field in order to improve its ability to model such systems. Finally, we show the impact of these changes on the dihedral angle distributions, persistence lengths, and conjugation length distributions observed during molecular dynamics simulations of poly[2-methoxy-5-(2?-ethylhexyloxy)-p-phenylene vinylene] (MEH-PPV) and poly 3-hexylthiophene (P3HT), two of the most widely used conjugated polymers.},
