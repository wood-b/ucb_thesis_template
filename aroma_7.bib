The structures of the multi-fluorinated thiophene derivatives have a noticeable influence on the optical properties and self-assembly properties of the polymers. Compared to P4F2T-C40, P4FTVT-C40 showed an ∼30 nm red-shift while P4FTAT-C40 exhibited an ∼60 nm blue-shift of the absorption spectrum. Top-gate and bottom-contact (TGBC) organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) of all the polymers exhibited ambipolar transport behavior. The devices based on P4FTAT-C40 displayed poor device performance since its film was almost amorphous. In contrast, the polymer based on 4FTVT with the same alkyl side chains delivered much better device performance due to its crystalline nature, favorable molecular orientations, and appropriate film morphology. With optimized side chains, P4FTVT-C32 exhibited the highest hole ($\mu$ h) and electron mobilities ($\mu$ e) of ca. 2.6 and ca. 8.0 cm 2 V −1 s −1 in air, respectively. ■ INTRODUCTION High mobility conjugated polymers (CPs) have drawn much attention these years due to their applications in solution-processed organic field-effect transistors (OFETs). 1−7 A prevailing strategy to design high mobility CPs is alternatively linking electron-rich and electron-deficient conjugated units to form donor−acceptor (D−A) conjugated polymers. 3,4,8,9 Over the past several years, diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) has emerged as one of the most popular A building blocks for high mobility D−A CPs because of its highly electron-deficient nature, planar structure, and ease of structural modification. 1,10−16 Moreover, not only p-type but also ambipolar and n-type high mobility D−A conjugated polymers can be obtained by tuning the chemical structures of comono-mers. 17−19 To date, DPP-based conjugated polymers are mainly synthesized by Pd-catalyzed Stille or Suzuki polycondensa-tions. These methods must go through tedious steps to get high-purity bifunctional organometallic reagents and may also involve toxic organotin compounds and byproducts. Certainly,},

abstract = {We report a large bandgap (1.9. eV) donor-acceptor copolymer (named PffT2-FTAZ) that enables polymer solar cells with a high power conversion efficiency of 7.8{\%}. An important structural feature of the PffT2-FTAZ polymer is a difluorinated donor unit (3,3'-difluoro-2,2'-bithiophene, or, ffT2) that introduces several surprising and/or beneficial effects. By comparing PffT2-FTAZ with the analog polymer (PT2-FTAZ) without fluorination on the bithiophene donor unit, it is found that the ffT2 unit effectively lowers the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymer and slightly reduces optical bandgap. It also introduces strong interchain aggregation for the polymer in solution, which leads to a highly crystalline polymer film and reasonably high hole transport mobility. On the other hand, the PffT2-FTAZ: fullerene blend still exhibits a reasonably small polymer domain size suitable for polymer solar cell operation. All these positive factors combined leads to dramatically enhanced performance for the polymer solar cells with the power conversion efficiency increasing from 2.8{\%} for PT2-FTAZ to 7.8{\%} for f PffT2-FTAZ. The high PSC performance of PffT2-FTAZ makes it a promising candidate for high efficiency tandem PSCs.},

NLO response properties of such chromophores are more sensitive to the electron excessivity of the bridges than to bridge aromaticity. Electron-excessive/deficient heterocyclic bridges have lesser/greater tendency to deplete the electron density from the donor/acceptor groups and thus increase their donor/acceptor ability. Thus, electron-excessive heterocyclic bridges act as auxiliary donors while electron-deficient heterocyclic bridges act as auxiliary acceptors, significantly enhancing NLO response. Interposing charged five-membered auxiliary donor and acceptor fragments between strong donor or acceptor groups results in large computed second-order NLO response},

abstract = {Neuromorphic computing could address the inherent limitations of conventional silicon technology in dedicated machine learning applications. Recent work on silicon-based asynchronous spiking neural networks and large crossbar arrays of two-terminal memristive devices has led to the development of promising neuromorphic systems. However, delivering a compact and efficient parallel computing technology that is capable of embedding artificial neural networks in hardware remains a significant challenge. Organic electronic materials offer an attractive option for such systems and could provide biocompatible and relatively inexpensive neuromorphic devices with low-energy switching and excellent tunability. Here, we review the development of organic neuromorphic devices. We consider different resistance-switching mechanisms, which typically rely on electrochemical doping or charge trapping, and report approaches that enhance state retention and conductance tuning. We also discuss the challenges the field faces in implementing low-power neuromorphic computing, such as device downscaling and improving device speed. Finally, we highlight early demonstrations of device integration into arrays, and consider future directions and potential applications of this technology.},

We propose that the starting point for understanding conjugated polymers includes understanding chain conformations and phase behavior. Efforts to predict and measure the persistence length have significantly refined our intuition of the chain stiffness, and have led to predictions of nematic-to-isotropic transitions. Exploring mixing between conjugated polymers and small molecules or other polymers has demonstrated tremendous advancements in attaining the needed properties for various optoelectronic devices.

abstract = {Non-covalent interactions hold the key to understanding many chemical, biological, and technological problems. Describing these non-covalent interactions accurately, including their positions in real space, constitutes a first step in the process of decoupling the complex balance of forces that define non-covalent interactions. Because of the size of macromolecules, the most common approach has been to assign van der Waals interactions (vdW), steric clashes (SC), and hydrogen bonds (HBs) based on pairwise distances between atoms according to their van der Waals radii. We recently developed an alternative perspective, derived from the electronic density: the Non-Covalent Interactions (NCI) index [J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010, 132, 6498]. This index has the dual advantages of being generally transferable to diverse chemical applications and being very fast to compute, since it can be calculated from promolecular densities. Thus, NCI analysis is applicable to large systems, including proteins and DNA, where analysis of non-covalent interactions is of great potential value. Here, we describe the NCI computational algorithms and their implementation for the analysis and visualization of weak interactions, using both self-consistent fully quantum-mechanical, as well as promolecular, densities. A wide range of options for tuning the range of interactions to be plotted is also presented. To demonstrate the capabilities of our approach, several examples are given from organic, inorganic, solid state, and macromolecular chemistry, including cases where NCI analysis gives insight into unconventional chemical bonding. The NCI code and its manual are available for download at http://www.chem.duke.edu/{\~{}}yang/software.htm.},

abstract = {Molecular geometry is of fundamental importance for any profound interpretation of molecular properties. This was elegantly pointed out by Roald Hoffmann and triggered intensive research in this direction. Experimental and theoretical methods enabling the determination of molecular geometry, developed since the mid-20th century, have provided numerical confirmation of the above-mentioned statement. Geometry-based aspects of aromaticity are the main subject of this Review. The theoretical method and the basis set used for estimation of HOMA constants should be the same as that used for geometry optimization of a given system. Their analysis was carried out for 25 systems and various advanced quantum-chemical models. The reference systems for the double CC, CN, and CO bond lengths are ethene, methylimine, and formaldehyde, respectively.},

abstract = {The intrinsic strength of pi interactions in conjugated and hyperconjugated molecules has been calculated using density functional theory by energy decomposition analysis (EDA) of the interaction energy between the conjugating fragments. The results of the EDA of the trans-polyenes H2C=CH-(HC=CH)n-CH=CH2 (n = 1-3) show that the strength of pi conjugation for each C=C moiety is higher than in trans-1,3-butadiene. The absolute values for the conjugation between Si=Si pi bonds are around two-thirds of the conjugation between C=C bonds but the relative contributions of DeltaE pi to DeltaE orb in the all-silicon systems are higher than in the carbon compounds. The pi conjugation between C=C and C=O or C=NH bonds in H2C=CH--C(H)=O and H2C=CH-C(H)=NH is comparable to the strength of the conjugation between C=C bonds. The pi conjugation in H2C=CH-C(R)=O decreases when R = Me, OH, and NH2 while it increases when R = halogen. The hyperconjugation in ethane is around a quarter as strong as the pi conjugation in ethyne. Very strong hyperconjugation is found in the central C-C bonds in cubylcubane and tetrahedranyltetrahedrane. The hyperconjugation in substituted ethanes X3C-CY3 (X,Y = Me, SiH3, F, Cl) is stronger than in the parent compound particularly when X,Y = SiH3 and Cl. The hyperconjugation in donor-acceptor-substituted ethanes may be very strong; the largest DeltaE pi value was calculated for (SiH3)3C-CCl3 in which the hyperconjugation is stronger than the conjugation in ethene. The breakdown of the hyperconjugation in X3C-CY3 shows that donation of the donor-substituted moiety to the acceptor group is as expected the most important contribution but the reverse interaction is not negligible. The relative strengths of the pi interactions between two C=C double bonds, one C=C double bond and CH3 or CMe3 substituents, and between two CH3 or CMe3 groups, which are separated by one C-C single bond, are in a ratio of 4:2:1. Very strong hyperconjugation is found in HC[triple bond]C-C(SiH3)3 and HC[triple bond]C-CCl3. The extra stabilization of alkenes and alkynes with central multiple bonds over their terminal isomers coming from hyperconjugation is bigger than the total energy difference between the isomeric species. The hyperconjugation in Me-C(R)=O is half as strong as the conjugation in H2C=CH-C(R)=O and shows the same trend for different substituents R. Bond energies and lengths should not be used as indicators of the strength of hyperconjugation because the effect of sigma interactions and electrostatic forces may compensate for the hyperconjugative effect.},

abstract = {The degree of aromaticity of monosubstituted derivatives of benzene has been investigated using different aromaticity indices calculated on the basis of molecular structure obtained at the MP2/cc-pvdz level of theory. It is demonstrated that, due to the violation of symmetry in $\pi$-systems, the introduction of any substituent in the benzene ring results in a decrease in the degree of aromaticity. It has been found that structural Bird and HOMA aromaticity indices do not reflect the strength of substituents and their ability to perturb ring electronic density in the benzene ring. The application of magnetic indices NICS0 and NICS1 results in an overestimation of aromaticity of substituted molecules with respect to benzene. Modifications of these indices (NICS-z and NICS-anis) reproduce well the character of the substituents except for functional groups containing carbonyl bonds. The values of NICS-z and NICS-anis correlate well with the ring out-of-plane deformation energy. However, the values of the ring deformation energy agree very well with the strength of all substituents including those containing carbonyl. Therefore, out-of-plane ring deformability is a more universal and sensitive aromaticity index than the known structural and magnetic indices. The values of ring deformation energy demonstrate linear correlation with the substituent that is constant for electron-donation and electron-withdrawing substituents. However, the former functional groups perturb more significantly the aromatic ring electron density. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Organochalcogen-nitrogen heterocycles such as the 1,2,5-chalcogenadiazoles have a distinct tendency to establish intermolecular links in the solid state through secondary bonding interactions E...N (E = S, Se, Te). The association of these molecules was examined in detail using relativistic density functional theory. Although there is an important electrostatic component, the interaction between these molecules is dominated by contributions arising from orbital mixing, which can be interpreted as the donation of a nitrogen lone pair into the chalcogen-centered antibonding orbitals. Because of its more polar character and lower-lying antibonding orbitals, the tellurium derivatives possess the strongest association energies; these are so large that the binding strength is comparable to that of some hydrogen bonds. In the absence of steric constraints, telluradiazoles associate in a coplanar fashion forming ribbon polymers. However, bulky susbstituents could be used to direct the formation of either helical chains or discrete dimers. In addition to its strength, the coplanar dimer is characterized by being rigid, yet no activation barrier is expected for the association/dissociation process. These attributes strongly indicate that tellurium-nitrogen heterocycles have great potential as building blocks in supramolecular architecture.},

The fluorinated polymer (PTBTz-F) showed remarkably enhanced hole mobility (mu(h) = 1.9 cm(2)/(V.S), on/off ratio = 8 x 10(7)) upon thermal annealing at 305 degrees C, compared to the unsubstituted one (PTBTz) (mu(h) = 7.0 x 10(-3) cm(2)/(V.s), on/off ratio = 3 x 10(6)). Alkoxy unit substitution (PTBTz-OR) also improved the carrier mobility up to 0.019 cm(2)/(V.s) with an on/off ratio of 4 x 10(5). Fluorine or alkoxy substitution induced tight interchain ordering with edge-on orientation, as confirmed by X-ray diffraction measurements.

abstract = {Constructing highly planar, extended $\pi$-electron systems is an important strategy for achieving high-mobility organic semiconductors. In general, there are two synthetic strategies for achieving $\pi$-conjugated systems with high planarity. The conventional strategy connects neighboring aromatic rings through covalent bonds to restrict the rotation about single bonds. However, this usually requires a complex sequence of synthetic steps to achieve this target, which can be costly and labor-intensive. More recently, noncovalent through-space intramolecular interactions, which are defined here as noncovalent conformational locks, have been employed with great success to increase the planarity and rigidity of extended $\pi$-electron systems; this has become a well-known and important strategy to design and synthesize highly planar $\pi$-conjugated systems for organic electronics.

However, Fourier analyses of the torsional potential energies were wholly consistent with hyperconjugative electron donation into the C-F $\sigma$* orbital contributing to the conformational preferences of these 1-fluoroethanes. Fourier analyses also showed that hyperconjugation contributes to the small variations in C-C and C-F bond lengths and in fluorine atomic charges that were computed.

abstract = {Many molecules can rotate internally around one or more of their bonds so that during a full 360 degrees rotation, they will change between unstable and relatively stable conformations. Ethane is the textbook example of a molecule exhibiting such behaviour: as one of its two methyl (CH3) groups rotates once around the central carbon-carbon bond, the molecule will alternate three times between an unstable eclipsed conformation and the preferred staggered conformation. This structural preference is usually attributed to steric effects; that is, while ethane rotates towards an eclipsed structure, the electrons in C-H bonds on the different C atoms are drawing closer to each other and therefore experience increased repulsion, introducing a rotation barrier that destabilizes the eclipsed structure. Stabilization of the staggered structure through rotation-induced weakening of the central C-C bond and hyperconjugation has been considered to be involved, but evaluation of the contributions of these effects to ethane's internal rotation barrier and conformational preference remains difficult. Here we report a series of ethane structure optimizations, where successive removal of different interactions indicates that ethane's staggered conformation is the result of preferential stabilization through hyperconjugation. Removal of hyperconjugation interactions yields the eclipsed structure as the preferred conformation, whereas repulsive forces, either present or absent, have no influence on the preference for a staggered conformation.},

abstract = {Nucleus-independent chemical shifts (NICS) have been used extensively for the identification of aromaticity properties of molecules, ions, intermediates, and transition states since their introduction in 1996 by Schleyer et al. Initially, probes (bq's) were placed at the centers of systems (NICS(0)) and later, 1A above the molecular planes (NICS(1)). However, contradicting assignments of aromaticity by NICS and other methods were found for some systems. In this article, an alternative NICS-based method is introduced. The method is based on scanning NICS values over a distance and separating them into in-plane and out-of plane contributions. The shapes of the plots of the chemical shifts and their components as a function of the distance of the NICS probe (bq) from the molecular plane give a clear indication of diamagnetic and paramagnetic ring currents. This method is applied to several (4n + 2)- and 4n pi-electron systems (molecules and ions) in the singlet and triplet electronic states, including some of the problematic systems mentioned above. It is also shown that relative aromaticities of rings in polycyclic systems (local aromaticities) cannot be estimated by comparing NICS or NICS-scan values.},

While acceptable statistical correlations were given by all of the NICS methods, the most fundamentally grounded index, NICS(0)pizz (based on the pi contribution to the out-of-plane zz tensor component), performed best statistically (cc=0.980) and in practice. The easily computable NICS(1)zz index is a useful alternative (cc=0.968).},

@article{Dubay2012,
abstract = {The modeling of the conformational properties of conjugated polymers entails a unique challenge for classical force fields. Conjugation imposes strong constraints upon bond rotation. Planar configurations are favored, but the concomitantly shortened bond lengths result in moieties being brought into closer proximity than usual. The ensuing steric repulsions are particularly severe in the presence of side chains, straining angles, and stretching bonds to a degree infrequently found in nonconjugated systems. We herein demonstrate the resulting inaccuracies by comparing the LMP2-calculated inter-ring torsion potentials for a series of substituted stilbenes and bithiophenes to those calculated using standard classical force fields. We then implement adjustments to the OPLS-2005 force field in order to improve its ability to model such systems. Finally, we show the impact of these changes on the dihedral angle distributions, persistence lengths, and conjugation length distributions observed during molecular dynamics simulations of poly[2-methoxy-5-(2?-ethylhexyloxy)-p-phenylene vinylene] (MEH-PPV) and poly 3-hexylthiophene (P3HT), two of the most widely used conjugated polymers.},
