\begin{acknowledgements}
  My time at Berkeley has been some of the best years of my life, both personally and professionally, largely due to the people around me. I have many to recognize, but above anyone else I would like to thank my advisor Kristin Persson. Kristin has provided unending support and guidance, and most importantly, empowered me to explore my own research ideas. In addition, I am extremely appreciative of the culture Kristin has instilled in her research group. Over the years, many Persson group members have contributed to my work and for that I am eternally grateful. Yongwoo Shin introduced me to conjugated polymers and put up with my constant stream of questions. Julian Self has been a fantastic person to discuss research with, and I am grateful for all our time spent together. Also, I would like to thank Shyam Dwaraknath and Sam Blau for the numerous scientific and non-scientific discussions and all of the writing and programming feedback.

  Other influential figures during my tenure at Berkeley were committee members Phill Geissler and Daryl Chrzan. Phill welcomed me to his group meetings and taught me statistical mechanics in his graceful style. Daryl Chrzan educated me on the value of a simple models, and we were able to enjoy our commonalities of growing up in Wisconsin and our joy for surfing.

  All of the work I accomplished at Berkeley would not have been possible without my friends. They provided balance and supported me through all the ups and downs of graduate school and life. Zack Phillips has been a great friend; he introduced me to surfing (a priceless gift) and never shied away from taking a surf break when it was necessary. I want to extend a special thanks to Alex Forse for all the help writing and inspiring me with all his passion for science and surfing. Also, I am also very grateful to Chris Lalau-Keraly for showing me the ways of the ocean and ensuring I have balance in my life and on my surfboard. Finally, I want to thank Jon Morris, Mika Endo, JB and Mike Chapman, Alix and Mike Mains, Ben Fildier, Helen Picot, Rebecca Barter, Dan Wooten, Raphaele Clement, and others for all the activities and adventures in California and beyond.

  Throughout my graduate studies my parents, Kerri and Dan, and my sister Lindsey have been a constant source of inspiration and encouragement. I credit my parents for providing me with the determination to see something to completion, and my sister for showing me how to deal with adversity. I also credit my grandfather Leonard Cook for imparting his curious and creative nature on me.

  I owe a great debt of gratitude to Fiona Doyle and Ken Valentas for helping me get into a doctoral program Berkeley. I would not be where I am today without them. Ken has been a long-time mentor and I can only hope to impact someoneâ€™s life as positively as he as impacted mine.

  Last, but certainly not least, I would like to thank the Department of Energy for financial support throughout my graduate studies at Berkeley.
